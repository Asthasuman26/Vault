# GitHub Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to initialize your Git repository and push it to GitHub:

## 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the '+' icon in the top right corner and select 'New repository'
3. Name your repository (e.g., 'Vault')
4. Choose whether the repository should be public or private
5. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license as we already have these files
6. Click 'Create repository'

## 2. Initialize Git Repository Locally

Open a terminal or command prompt in your project directory and run the following commands:

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Add all files to the staging area
git add .

# Commit the files
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add the GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/Vault.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Note: If your default branch is named 'master' instead of 'main', use:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

Or rename your branch to 'main' before pushing:

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Verify Your Repository

Go to your GitHub repository URL (https://github.com/yourusername/Vault) to verify that all files have been pushed correctly.

## 4. Additional Steps

- Set up branch protection rules in your GitHub repository settings if needed
- Enable GitHub Actions if you want to use the CI/CD workflow
- Invite collaborators if you're working with a team

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with pushing to GitHub, make sure:

1. You have the correct permissions for the repository
2. Your GitHub credentials are configured correctly
3. There are no conflicts between local and remote repositories
